## ! Warning ! This engine in its current state exists as a TECHNICAL PREVIEW, not a fully functional editor. 
What does this mean? </br></br>
This means that the editor is fundamentally not ready for complete game development yet, and is being made public in its current state to prove and share a concept, similar to a game's 'vertical slice' it exists as a concept and a chance to try something new, not a feature-complete tool. </br></br>
What's the point?</br></br>
The point is threefold, I want to share what I'm creating, I want early feedback on how features feel, and I want others to be able to test the software and get a feel for the expierence.</br></br>
How do I try it out?</br></br>
Navigate to the `Release` section and select the latest release.</br> (Currently only available on windows, but linux support coming soon and mac support is planned)</br>

## 2D and 3D Cross Platform Game Engine
This editor aims to be a feature packed 2D and 3D environment with powerful and intuitive tooling and an easy to use interface, which allows for the seemless creation of a wide variety of video games, with a focus on accelerating prototyping and removing some of the frictio of early developmet, allowing you to focus on what makes your game unique as quickly as possible. </br>
Though not currently supported, the infrastructure exists for eventual export to Linux, Windows (implemented), and Mac, as well as eventual support for Web, and (possibly) console.

## Free and Open Source
I believe all tools should be free -- so I'm putting it into practice. Lupine Engine is 100% free to download and use, no royalties, no premium features, no caveats. </br>
Furthermore, the engine is completely open-source and welcomes any contributions that anyone may be interested in providing. For the last 6 years this engine has been a passion project of mine, and it would mean the world to me to see others contribute to the efforts.

## Installation Instructions
Windows </br>
Installing for windows is as simple as downloading the editor and runtime executables and launching `lupine-editor.exe`. (Please make sure that the two executables remain siblings of each other (in the same folder) otherwise the editor will not be able to launch the runtime execution)
</br></br>
Linux </br>
Coming soon. (will be available as .deb package and hopefully others in the coming months)
</br></br>
MacOS </br>
Coming Soon

## Build Instructions
Due to an issue in my development environment, the make file is currently hardcoded to find the packages it needs, to build it you need to either update it to point to your local packages for these files or edit the makefile to use vcpkg/conan/toolchain of choice.
